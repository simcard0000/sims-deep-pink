        * Next, open up the Troubleshooting Information tab in Thunderbird and open the Profile Folder. Insert the `chrome` folder (under the `thunderbird` folder at the root of this repository) in this Profile Folder location.
        * Restart the Thunderbird application and enjoy!
> [!WARNING]
> The Thunderbird theme is not fully implemented yet, and has so far been tested only in v115. The necessary files are located in the `thunderbird` folder at the root of this repository.
