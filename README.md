### Supported Products

* [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-CA/)
    * This theme relies on using custom CSS to implement colour changes. To get started:
        * Open Thunderbird and navigate to Settings. Scroll to the very bottom and open up the Config Editor. Modify the `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` value to **true**.
        * Next, open up the Troubleshooting Information tab in Thunderbird and open the Profile Folder. Insert the `chrome` folder (under the `thunderbird` folder at the root of this repository) in this Profile Folder location.
        * Restart the Thunderbird application and enjoy!
